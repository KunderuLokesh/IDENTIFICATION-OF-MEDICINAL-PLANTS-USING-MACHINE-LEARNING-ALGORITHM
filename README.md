# IDENTIFICATION-OF-MEDICINAL-PLANTS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHM
📌 Project Description

Identification of Medicinal Plants is a deep learning–based image classification project that automatically recognizes medicinal plants from leaf images. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features such as shape, texture, and color to accurately classify different medicinal plant species. This project aims to simplify plant identification and promote the application of AI in healthcare and agriculture domains.

🔍 Project Overview

Medicinal plants are widely used in traditional medicine and pharmaceutical research, but their identification often requires expert knowledge. This project provides an automated solution using computer vision and deep learning. A CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset of medicinal plant images with data augmentation techniques to improve robustness and accuracy. The trained model can predict the plant type from a single input image.
