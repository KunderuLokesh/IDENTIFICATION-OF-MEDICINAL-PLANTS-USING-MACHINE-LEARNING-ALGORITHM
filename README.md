🌿 Identification of Medicinal Plants Using Deep Learning

📌 Project Description

Identification of Medicinal Plants is a deep learning–based image classification project that automatically recognizes medicinal plants from leaf images. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features such as shape, texture, and color to accurately classify different medicinal plant species. This project aims to simplify plant identification and promote the application of AI in healthcare and agriculture domains.
